# BooksNook
Book's Nook Website code

Thanks for taking a look at all the chaos here!

This is my first real solo attempt at coding and web development. Have to tell you, I really feel over my head and I'm loving it.

# The Website
The website is currently deployed on heroku.
https://books-nook.herokuapp.com

I'm trying to work through the issues right now and keep running into issues with session cookies and the saving of the SQL. I'm reading the SQL is because I'm just using SQLite and so I just started diving into PostgreSQL. The big issue I'm encountering right now I think is session cookies. When you log in, the site might remember you for a few moments, but then it is lost and you have to log in again. Not sure what is causing this, but I'm trying to work on it now!

Thanks!
